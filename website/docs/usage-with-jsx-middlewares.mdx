# Usage with JSX Middlewares

It is possible to use `react-clarify` with JSX middlewares.

Firstly, you need to install `jsx-middlewares`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install jsx-middlewares
```

Then, you need to set-up `jsx-middlewares` for your project. You can visit docs for how to [setup your JSX transpiler](https://gkurt.com/jsx-middlewares/#setup-your-jsx-transpiler). For most Typescript projects, this should work:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsxImportSource": "jsx-middlewares/react"
  }
}
```

Then, import `react-clarify/middlewares` once in your entry file.

```js title="main.ts"
import 'react-clarify/middlewares';
```

Now, you can use `react-clarify` with JSX middlewares.

```jsx title="Example.jsx"
<div $tracking={{ userId: '...', orgId: '...' }}>
  <button $trackEvent='click'>Click Me</button>
</div>
```

Available directives are:

- `$tracking` - Sets tracking context for all children.
- `$trackEvent` - Tracks the DOM event for the element.
- `$trackCallback` - Attaches a callback to the element, which triggers a tracking event when called.
