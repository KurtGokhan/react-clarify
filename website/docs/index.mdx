# React Clarify

React Clarify is a library that allows you to instrument your React components for declarative user tracking and analytics.

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-clarify
```

## Usage

React Clarify works by defining the tracking context in a cascading manner. Let's see with an example:

<CodeBlock language="jsx">{indexSrc}</CodeBlock>

In summary, there are 3 group of components you need to know about:

- `Tracking` is a context provider for defining the data that will be passed to the tracking handler. data for the nested `Tracking` will be merged together.
- `TrackingHandler` is for defining a callback function that will be called when a tracking event is fired. `ConsoleTrackingHandler` is a predefined handler for simply logging the tracked data to the console. Handlers can be nested to call them all when a tacking event occurs.
- `TrackEvent` and is used to fire a tracking event when a DOM event occurs. It's children must be a single React component that takes a ref.
  - As an alternative to `TrackEvent`, `TrackCallback` can be used to fire tracking events using not just DOM events, but any arbitrary callback function. It can be used like `<TrackCallback callback="onClick">`.
  - `useTrack` hook can be used to get a function that can be used to fire a tracking event that can be called manually.

Let's see the result of the example above:

<BrowserWindow>
  <IndexExample />
</BrowserWindow>
